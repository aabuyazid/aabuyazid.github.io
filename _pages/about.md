Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

### Quick Introduction 
<!---
My journey with all things software/hardware related started with a single goal:
to expand the way we express ourselves digitally and building 
the space within the intersection of engineering and art. I have explored the fields of
eletrical engineering and computer science to find my place in the world, from systems
engineering, computer architecture, and compilers design for hardware
accelerators to high-level applications such as deep learning and image processing.

My name is Arkan Abuyazid, and I am a computer science master's student at Texas
A&M University. 
My journey as an engineer in tech began with two career missions. One, I aim to support
scientists and artists achieve the impossible by supplying solutions in the
forms of software and hardware to address their computing needs. Two, I strive
to build consumer products that drastically improve the lives of the common
person. I have explored the fields of electrical engineering and computer
science to find my place in the world, from computer architecture and compiler
design for hardware accelerators to high-level applications such as deep
learning and image processing.

<!---
It turns out that my career goals and personal aspirations resonate most with
the GPU and parallel computing at large. 
All efforts spent towards the development and utilization of these technologies 
directly advance our current modes of expression in digital art as well as hint at
new avenues to project our fantastical imagination. As
such, I delved deeper into the applications of GPUs and parllel computing. I incorporated 
embedded computer vision to create an assitive tool for the blind, utilized 
deep learning to explore the tradeoffs between the compression level of an image and its
human-perceived quality, and linked graphics APIs like Vulkan to my custom 3D
game engine.

<!---
In my next phase of my career as a master's student at Texas A&M University, 
I intend to continue exploring more applications of GPUs, such as the underlying
mathematics of graphics and current state-of-the-art deep learning algorithms. 
I also intend to broaden my understanding of the GPU's architecture and master
how to design parallel algorithms that realize its full potential.
--->

With those two missions as my compass, I have decided to explore different 
algorithms that utilize GPUs and parallel computing as well as their applications.
The problems scientists, artists, and the world at large face are only
getting more complex; therefore, my solutions must become that much smarter. 
In my next phase of my career as a master's student, 
I intend to explore graphics, scientific disciplines outside of computing, and current deep
learning models. I also intend to broaden my understanding of the GPU's architecture 
and master how to design parallel algorithms.

To accomplish these tasks, I am involved in various clubs and organizations,
being active in academia, and taking computational science courses. 
I am currently building embedded AI/ML models for a start-up whose mission 
is to provide full home automation at an affordable price. My aim is to
extend the capabilities of their flagship product by applying utilizing my 
knowledge in image processing and embedded systems. I am also engaged in
the Aggies Coding Club, where I am contributing to their own game engine. My goal is
to familiarize myself more with the game developer space and support my team
members in their C++ development journey.

**I am open to opportunities in Scientific Computing, AI Software/Algorithms, GPU Software, and Backend Engineering**
<!---
I am a computer engineer capable of creating novel solutions and
systems in low-level, embedded/systems software, CPU chip design, and high-level
back-end development for mobile applications. I believe my interests in low-latency
computing and fascination with algorithm design makes me the ideal engineer
to work on projects that require fast implementations of systems, APIs, and
more. Knowing mere milliseconds can make or break the success of the
project, I strive to find the most efficient and quickest method for any task.
