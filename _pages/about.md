Write your biography here. Tell the world about yourself. Link to your favorite [subreddit](http://reddit.com). You can put a picture in, too. The code is already in, just name your picture `prof_pic.jpg` and put it in the `img/` folder.

Put your address / P.O. box / other info right below your picture. You can also disable any of these elements by editing `profile` property of the YAML header of your `_pages/about.md`. Edit `_bibliography/papers.bib` and Jekyll will render your [publications page](/al-folio/publications/) automatically.

Link to your social media connections, too. This theme is set up to use [Font Awesome icons](http://fortawesome.github.io/Font-Awesome/) and [Academicons](https://jpswalsh.github.io/academicons/), like the ones below. Add your Facebook, Twitter, LinkedIn, Google Scholar, or just disable all of them.

I am a computer engineer capable of creating novel solutions and
systems in low-level, embedded/systems software, CPU chip design, and high-level
back-end development for mobile applications. I believe my interests in low-latency
computing and fascination with algorithm design makes me the ideal engineer
to work on projects that require fast implementations of systems, APIs, and
more. Knowing mere milliseconds can make or break the success of the
project, I strive to find the most efficient and quickest method for any task.
