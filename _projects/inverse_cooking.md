As described in the about section, I have strong interests in image processing 
and computer vision. I believe that there is untapped potential int these fields
to assist others day-to-day and improve the overall human condition. To further
familiarize myself in the field, I opted to explore imaginative use cases that 
pushes the boundaries of the field of computer vision. One of these use cases is
a model that analyzes an image of a dish and outputs a recipe complete with
ingredients, measurements of said ingredients, and instructions to make the
dish. That paper is Meta's *Inverse Cooking: Recipe Generation from Food Images*

By training the underlying model and comparing its performance to the benchmarks
listed in the paper, I was able to do the following:
- Developed further intuition in computer vision as well as introduce myself to
  the field of natural language processing.
- Strengthed my skills in building and training convolutional neural networks
  and transformer models in PyTorch. 
- Refamiliazed myself with high-performance computing clusters.
